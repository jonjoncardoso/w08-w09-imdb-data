    "# Part 1: Read zipped files\n",
    "\n",
    "You will have noticed that the files we downloaded from IMDb are compressed, which means they were transformed from **plain text** into a convenient **binary format** that uses less space. This is a good practice when handling large text-based files, making them easier to store and transfer. However, we _do_ need to read the files into memory, and for that, we need to decompress them.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How to decompress files?**\n",
    "\n",
    "- If you are on Windows, you can use software like [7-Zip](https://www.7-zip.org/). After installing it, right-click on the file and select \"Extract here\".\n",
    "- If you are on Mac, you can use the built-in Archive Utility. Right-click on the file and select \"Open with\" > \"Archive Utility\". Or, simply double-click on the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "**üêº `pandas` for the rescue!**\n",
    "\n",
    "Luckily, `pandas` has our back. It can read compressed files directly without the need to decompress them first. If you specify the `compression` argument, the `pd.read_csv()` function can read compressed files directly  <sup>\\[[1](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.read_csv.html)\\]</sup>\n",
    "\n",
    "If the file inside the compressed `.gz` file was a CSV, we could read it like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "pd.read_csv(\"../data/raw/name.basics.tsv.gz\", compression=\"gzip\").head()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "However, note that the files we downloaded from IMDb are **TSV** files, not CSV. TSV stands for **Tab-Separated Values**, and it is a format similar to CSV, but instead of using commas to separate values, it uses tabs (`\\t`). Why use TSV? Who knows. The developers thought it was a good idea, I guess. \n",
    "\n",
    "Anyway, since the format is still very similar to CSV, we can use the same function to read it, but we need to specify the `sep` argument to tell `pandas` that the separator is a tab (`\\t`):"
